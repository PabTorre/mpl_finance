This module forks the deprecated matplotlib.finance. 
With the purpose of integrating the functionalities of this module into pandas. 

Goals: 
   1. Remove all functionality that is duplicate in pandas. 
   2. Build the Candlesticka and OHLC charts in a way that is easy to integrate 
      with the classes found in into pandas.DataFrame.plotting._core 
   3. Integrate into pandas plotting and terminate this module.
